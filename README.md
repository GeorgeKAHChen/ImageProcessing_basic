# ImageProcessing_in_USTB
This program is the code I had written or I will write during my Image Processing course in USTB.<br/>
As usual I will still use Python, which is the most beautiful program language (just a joke).<br/>
And if you are my friend or student in my school, you can also use these code during this class.<br/>
By the way, my class is teaching with both Chinese and English. So don't care about why I often using English during the program<br/>

By the way, you may need to install these packages<br/>
pip3 install Pillow<br/>
pip3 install matplotlib<br/>
<br/>
And, it is confident that these can work without bug in the MacOS or Linux(or all Unix). Although it is can be compiled in Windows, I still not confident if they have any bug in Windows System, espacelly Windows10 (or Bug10)

WARNING:
Althrough homeworks can work in the Windows System, The main program with paper <b>CANNOT</b> working even compiling on Windows System!!
