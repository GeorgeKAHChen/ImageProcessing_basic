# ImageProcessing_in_USTB
This program is the code I had written or I will write during my Image Processing course in USTB.<br/>
As usual I will still use Python, which is the most beautiful program language (just a joke).<br/>
And if you are my friend or student in my school, you can also use these code during this class.<br/>
By the way, my class is teaching with both Chinese and English. So don't care about why I often using English during the program<br/>
