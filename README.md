# ImageProcessing_in_USTB (Finished, version 2.0)
I finished all this program finally.<br/>
A long time journey, I used about 14 week to finished all this program.<br/>
However, this program still have some little bug which I am not confident. As I will use this program to finish some research, I think I will find them and recovery.<br/>
## Surrounding
`Warning: As I did nothing of compatibilityï¼Œ DO Not using this program on Windows system. You can use this program on UNIX 
You should install some package before using it, and I will give you the installation function with pip3`
<br/>
STEP 1: Install Python3<br/>
For Linux Ubuntu and Debain system<br/>
```
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ipython3
```
For Fedora and Red-hat system<br/>
```
    sudo yum upgrade
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install python3 python3-pip ipython3
```
For Mac OS<br/>
You should insttall brew first<br/>
```
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
And install python3<br/>
```
    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew install python3 python3-pip ipython3
```

STEP 2: Install python package<br/>
```
    pip3 install Pillow
    pip3 install matplotlib
    pip3 install PyWavelets
```
You should also install opev-cv, however, as the installation of open-cv is so different, I cannot give you some confident method to install it. Here I will give you a reference of open-cv installation.<br/>
For Linux<br/>
https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html<br/>
For Mac OS<br/>
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/<br/>

STEP 3: Download the program<br/>
You can download this program with git, and I will show you how to use it.<br/>
```
    git clone https://github.com/KazukiAmakawa/ImageProcessing_in_USTB/
```

## Usage
This program will read all jpg, png and bmp figures in the program folders without /Output. If you want to using a figure, you need just put it in the root folders, or build a folder which have name you like and not /Output. <br/>
You can begin all the program with the command <br/>
```
    python3 Main.py
```
First in first, you need to choose the figure you want to use. Print the code of figure and press ENTER.<br/>
![image](http://stlaplace.com/img/Git/1.png)
Here, you can choose you need using this figure for a long time or just one case. If you input n or N, after algorithm, you need choose a new figure, else, you can use this figure for a long time.<br/>
![image](http://stlaplace.com/img/Git/2.png)
After that, you can choose the algorithm you need, or input 0 to exit and -1 to choose another figure.<br/>
![image](http://stlaplace.com/img/Git/3.png)
If you used any algorithm, the system will ask you if you need save this figure or not, all the figure will be saved in folder /Output (Thats why all figure in /Output will not be read).<br/>
![image](http://stlaplace.com/img/Git/4.png)
The system will also ask you if you need using this figure or not. If you input y or Y, you can use other tools working on the figure after algorithm.<br/>

## Others
The main program which I am working on is based on the function 21) Random Walk Algorithm. It is called as criea(CNN and Random walk Image Edge Algorithm). Here is the main page of this program (Chinese):<br/>

## History version
This program is the code I had written or I will write during my Image Processing course in USTB.<br/>
As usual I will still use Python, which is the most beautiful program language (just a joke).<br/>
And if you are my friend or student in my school, you can also use these code during this class.<br/>
By the way, my class is teaching with both Chinese and English. So don't care about why I often using English during the program<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kazuki Amakawa<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, you may need to install these packages<br/>
pip3 install Pillow<br/>
pip3 install matplotlib<br/>
You may also need install opencv if you want to run these code normally. As the installing of opencv in different system are different, I cannot tell you all the method you need. However, if you are macos, you can install it with the method below<br/>
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/<br/>
<br/>
And, it is confident that these can work without bug in the MacOS or Linux(or all Unix). Although it is can be compiled in Windows, I still not confident if they have any bug in Windows System, espacelly Windows10 (or Bug10)
<br/>
<br/>
WARNING:
Althrough homeworks can work in the Windows System, The main program with paper <b>CANNOT</b> working even compiling on Windows System!!<br/>
